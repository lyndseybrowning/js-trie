# Javascript Trie Generator

This is a function that generates a [Trie structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) based on an existing array of words.

It is heavily based on John Resig's Trie Performance Analysis found [here](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-trie-performance-analysis/).

It is an optimised/modernised version of the code I am currently using in my game: [Wordscrambler](www.word-scrambler.co.uk). It allows for great performance using depth-first searching and recursion.
